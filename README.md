# whatsappbot
A simple and stupid python bot for Whatsapp which uses Whatsapp Web and Selenium Webdriver

I wrote this bot in about half an hour, including reverse engineering the Whatsapp Web website, so it's not great, but it gets the job done.

There are no comments, but the code should be understandable anyways.

whatsappbot.py is the class which does the whole work.

main.py just imports it and writes Spam into a specified Group in an infinite loop.

This was just a little experiment I wanted to share, so don't expect anything in this repo to happen
